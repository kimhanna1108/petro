                                    <p>Group II 기유로 전환하면서 가스터빈 유체의 산화 및 열 안정성이 향상되었습니다. 
                                        그러나 이 전환으로 인해 용해도가 감소하고, 그로 인한 비용이 많이 드는 부작용으로 바니시(침전물) 형성이 증가하는 문제가 발생했습니다. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        이에 따라 운영자들은 바니시 축적을 효과적으로 억제할 수 있는 적합한 터빈 유체를 선택해야 할 필요성이 더욱 커졌습니다. 
                                        이를 위해 업계는 유체 시험 방법을 업데이트해야 하는데, 기존의 회전 압력 용기 산화 시험(RPVOT)에만 의존하는 것은 터빈 유체를 비교하는 데 효과적이지 않다는 것이 입증되었기 때문입니다. 
                                        이로 인해 잘못된 정보가 운영자들로 하여금 가스터빈에 덜 효과적인 유체를 선택하게 만들 수 있습니다.
