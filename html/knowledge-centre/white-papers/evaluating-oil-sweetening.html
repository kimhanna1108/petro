                                    <p><strong>Oil sweetening, or slipstreaming,</strong> is a relatively common
                                        practice among some operators of natural gas compressors. It involves drawing
                                        used oil from the engine and feeding it into the compressor component to
                                        lubricate the packing and cylinders of the equipment.</p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>It&rsquo;s not difficult to see why some operators have turned to oil sweetening.
                                        As long as the application is low-dilution and non-severe, it is possible to use
                                        a standard SAE 40 stationary gas engine oil to lubricate the compressor rods and
                                        packings. Using, and therefore having to stock, just one product rather than two
                                        may also seem to align with a company&rsquo;s financial goals as the initial oil
                                        spend will be lower as there are fewer units and tanks to fill.</p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>Yet some industry experts may argue that while oil sweetening can be possible for
                                        some applications, it is far from ideal. The process can affect used oil
                                        analysis reports and potentially mask issues with the engine that can cause
                                        costly repairs down the line. Using specialized compressor oils for gas
                                        compressors can also improve the performance of the equipment and actually
                                        equate to a cheaper cost per gallon than engine oils.</p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>But it&rsquo;s most important to have all the facts. In this white paper,
                                        we&rsquo;ll explore oil sweetening (also commonly referred to as
                                        &ldquo;slipstreaming&rdquo;) from a technical perspective, consider the benefits
                                        and disadvantages of this practice, and provide recommendations for you to keep
                                        in mind.</p>
